            I felt this way untill i decided its time to **level up a little bit** and come out of my confort zone. Using `GUI` tools. In my case **visual studio code**.

            Do you feel this way?
            ![git feeling](/images/gitfeeling.png)

            Its a sad place to be. **_Are you exited to not do this anymore!?_**

            I will try to get you out of this showing you how to **use git the right way.**

            Before you delete you could decide to look up some manual page for git online and this is what you might get.
