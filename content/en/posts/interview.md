### Interview Cheat Sheet

The 2 pillars of good code:

1. Readability
2. Time Complexity
3. Space Complexity

### What skills interviews is looking for.

1. **Analytic Skills** - How can you think through problems and
   anlyze things?
2. **Coding Skills** - Do you code well, by writing clean,
   simple, organized, readable Code?
3. **Technical Knowledge** - Do you know the fundamentals of the
   job you're applying for?
4. **Communication Skill** - Does your personality match the
   companies culture?

### Step By Step through a Problem.

1. When the interviewer says the question, write down the key
   points at the top (**sorted array**). Makes ure you have all
   the details. Show how organized you are.

2. Make sure you double check: What are the inputs? What are the
   outputs?
3. What is the most important value of the problec? Do you have
   time, and space and memory etc.. What is the main goal?
4. Don't be annoying and ask to many questions.
5. Start with the naive/brute force approach. First thing that
   comes into mind. It shows that you're able to think well and
   critically (you don't need to write this code, just speak
   about it)
6. Tell them why this approach is not the best. The O(n\*2) or
   higher , not readable.
7. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you
   may be able to break things. Any repetition, bottleneks like
   O(n^2)
