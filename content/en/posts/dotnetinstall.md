### Working with My Server Remotely From Visual Studio Code.

Once I installed **dotnet** successfully in my **ubuntu** server. I needed to connect remotely from my **vscode** in order to make quick changes on the server. But ominisharp does not seem to find **any sdk** installed. The solution was to create a sybolic link as shown below.

Run The command below to find out where you dotnet installation is located. Since we used snap to install, its located in the /snap folder.

```bash
which dotnet
/snap/bin/dotnet
```

Add the line to your **bashrc** or **zshrc** file.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin/dotnet
```
