## Devops Series

I will teach git the way I would want to be taught. **I use alot of diagrams , images and I employ repetition**. I will introduce a command and build on it. When we are doing repettion of a command , I don't necessary use the same procedure as before, this helps you understading more.

This is **hands-on workshop** make sure you follow along, we all learn better by doing. When I was preparing the material, I realized I could restrict myself to teach git only, then later a realized if i was going to use the cli i would have to do some **cli basic**. I decide to prepare this notes for you to be able to follow along or even refer to them later.

I could decide to cover git in a one-off session. But by doing that I would limit use to cover a small chuck. I want to help you be great and improve your overall productivity. I believe a part of being a great developer in not limit yourself to **getting started with a tech.**.
