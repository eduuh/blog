### Algorithms

What makes an algorithm fast? To answer this question, it tend to be grouped in two categories. With respect to input size
and also assuming the worst case scenario.

* Time complexity
* Space Comlexity


###### Time complexity
Here we answer the question of how many primitive **operations** are executed?

Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run to completion. The tim complexity of algorithms is
more commonly expressed usind the big O notation.

Big-O notation gives us an Industry-standard language to discuss the performance of algorithms. Not  knowing how to speak this language
can make you stand out as an inexperienced programmer.

##### Space Complexity
Here we are answering the question of How much **memory** is Used?

### Problem to think On
Given a list of hotels return the price range of hotels in a given search result. Lets write the algorithm..
```Javascript
var hotels = [
    {price : 200, brand : "best eastern"}
    ....
]
```

### solution
We'd expect that the more data we have, the longer it will take to figure out the min and max required for the range.
However, as our dataset grows, the cost can grow really fast or slow!
##### Approch 1 : Compare all numbes to one another.
As our data grows, how much does our work increases?

|# of hotels (n) | 3   | 5    | 10  | 100 |
|----------------|-----|------|-----|-----|
|#ops            | 9   |25    | 100 | 1000|
We can call this n^2 ,where n is the number of hotels. As n grows, the amount of work increases at that rate.

## Approach two: Trach min & max
How many comparison were made? We have to for loops each tracking the minimum and the max values.

we consider this 2*n because as the data grows, the number of work increase by 2.
Its faster, less comparison are made for this.

## Approach 3: Sorted List
Here you know where the min and max. We get the first and the last numbers.

| # Operations Big-O      |Algorithm                              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| n^2 (quadratic)         | compares all the numbers              |
| 2n  (Linear)            | Find min and and max values           |
| 2   ,constant           | Sorted list find first and last       |


As the input grows.

[super fast](#)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->[super slow](#)
|Name   |constant | logarithmic |linear | quadratic | exponential|
|-------|---------|-------------|-------|-----------|------------|
|Notation|O(1)    | O(logn)     | O(n)  | O(n^2)    | O(e^n)     |

## Native Methods & JS Expressions
### Time complexities
1. Arrays : linear
```Javascript
const arr = [1,2,3]
arr.pop() //=> {1,2]} 
arr[1] // dont need to start from index one, it know where the value is
```
2. Object : linear
```Javascript
const obj = {a: 1};
obj.a // -> 1

```
## Calculating Time
What to we do if we have multiple expressions/loops/etc?



> #### what about o(logn)?
A little better that linear. 

## Complexity of Common Operations

|complexity    |  operation                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
|  O(1)        | Running a statement                  |
|  O(1)        | value look-up on array, object,variable|
|  O(logn)     | loop that cuts a problem in half every iteration|
|  O(n)        | Looping through the value of an array |
|  O(n^2)      | Double nested loops                   |
|  O(n^3)      | Tripple nested loops                  |

### Space Complecity
The space that it take up in the memory. Are you making a new 
data structure how often are you doing that?.
