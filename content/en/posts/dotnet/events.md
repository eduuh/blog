**Methods** are often describled as **action that an object can perform, either on itself or to related objects**. For example, a List can add an item to itself or clear itself , and file can creae or delete a file in the filesystem.

Events are often decribed as **action that happens to an object.** For example , in a user interface, **Buttons** has a click event, click being somethong that happens to a button. Another way of thinking of events is that they provide a way to exchainging messages between two objects.

Events are build on **delegates**.
